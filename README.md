# Sales-Dashboard
# The data set had been cleaned and was in order, so I used PowerBi to create the visual where I showed the total revenue, total quantity sold, total products, total salesperson, total customer and total region. Also I visualised some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the data such Revenue by months, Revenue by Sales Person, Revenue by Item, Revenue by Region and Quantity by Item. The data had five products which were Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4 and Item 5. 
The Revenue by Months showed the revenue made in each months and March had the highest revenue of 230383. It was visualised using a line chart.
The Revenue by Sales person showed the revenue made by different sales person in the data and Anna Weber was the sales person that had the highest sales. It was visualised using a clustered bar chart.
The Revenue by Item showed the amount that was gotten from the sales of the five products and Item 1 was mostly sold which generated the highest revenue of close to 740,000. It was visualised using a clustered column chart.
The Revenue by region showed the revenue gotten from each region and there were four region in the data which were New Mexico, Arizona, California and Texas, in which Texas had the highest revenue. The Revenue by Region was visualised using a Donut chart.
The Quantity by Item showed the quantity sold of each of the products and it was visualised usind a stacked column chart. Item 1 had the most number of quantity sold which was 1895.
